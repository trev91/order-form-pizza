This project is focused on the basic functionality of allowing a user to order pizza, with a few particulars.
IE, pizza sizes are different prices, toppings are different prices, and certain sizes have a max topping limit.
The user can add pizzas to their cart freely, track their order total, as well as remove pizzas from their cart.

That's it :)

Built using Apollo Client / GraphQL / React.js. Enjoy!
